-- How to copy the data from one table to another table
Create table order_archived as -- In this example A new table will be create with name order_archived and all the orders table data will be copied in to this 
SELECT * from orders;

-- Now we already have a table and only copy the data from orders table
INSERT INTO order_archived
SELECT * FROM orders where order_date > '2019-01-01';

-- But the main issue is if the orders table contains any primary key or any specific field then it will not come automatically in this table

-- Exercise

-- 1. Client name should be in the table
-- 2. Only those results should be there whose payment details is not null
