select * from Customers
where birth_date > '1990-01-01' or points > 1000 and state = 'VA';

-- order of  logical order 
-- AND
-- OR

-- so the query will look like this during the execution
SELECT * 
FROM Customers
WHERE (birth_date > '1990-01-01')
   OR (points > 1000 AND state = 'VA');


 -- now suppose I added the NOT before the condition
select * from Customers
where NOT (birth_date > '1990-01-01' or points > 1000 and state = 'VA');

-- then for the sake of understanding we can execute this query like this
select * from Customers
where birth_date <= '1990-01-01' and points <= 1000 or state != 'VA';


-- exercise
--  fetch the data from order_items table where orderr is 6 and total price is greater than 30 
SELECT * FROM order_items
WHERE order_id = 6 and quantity * unit_price > 30
