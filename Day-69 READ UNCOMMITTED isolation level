got rollback with any reason then business will get wrong decision on the basis of uncommitted changes read


use sql_store;
set transaction isolation level read uncommitted;
select points
from customers
where customer_id = 1;

use sql_store;
start transaction;
update customers
set points = 20
where customer_id = 1;
commit;
