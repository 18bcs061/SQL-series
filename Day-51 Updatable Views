-- We can update the view if it's not contains these things
-- Aggregate Functions (MIN , MAX , sum)
-- GROUP BY / HAVING
-- UNION

-- We use VIEW in that case suppose we don't have the access to create or update anything in the exisitng table then we follow this concept

USE sql_invoicing;
-- NOW HERE I WILL CREATE A VIERW FOR invoice table WHICH WILL HAVE A COLUMN WHICH IS NOT IN invoice TABLE CALLED BALANCE
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW invoices_with_balance AS
SELECT 
	invoice_id,
    number,
    client_id,
    invoice_total,
    payment_total,
    invoice_total - payment_total AS balance,
    invoice_date,
    payment_date
FROM invoices    
WHERE (invoice_total - payment_total) > 0;


-- Now how to DELETE particular record from veiw
DELETE FROM invoices_with_balance
WHERE invoice_id = 1;

-- Now update the date from two days from current for id =2
UPDATE invoices_with_balance
SET invoice_date = DATE_ADD(invoice_date , INTERVAL 2 DAY)
WHERE invoice_id = 2
