When both transaction wait for each other to get complete

Example

use sql_store;
start transaction;
update customers set state = 'VA' where customer_id = 1;
update orders set status = 1 where order_id = 1;
commit;


use sql_store;
start transaction;
update orders set status = 1 where order_id = 1;
update customers set state = 'VA' where customer_id = 1;
commit;


when we will run these both transaction then it will throw the error of deadlock
