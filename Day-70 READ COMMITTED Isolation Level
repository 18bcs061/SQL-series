If we will set read committed then we will not get the uncommitted data so it removes the issue of uncommitted read


use sql_store;
set transaction isolation level read committed;
select points
from customers
where customer_id = 1;

use sql_store;
start transaction;
update customers
set points = 20
where customer_id = 1;
commit;


But this is now not handelling the Non-Repeatable Reads suppose
use sql_store;
set transaction isolation level read committed;
select points from customers where customer_id = 1;
select points from customers where customer_id = 1;

use sql_store;
start transaction;
update customers
set points = 30
where customer_id = 1;
commit;

Now suppose first select statement works then it will return the 20 but after second transaction runs and then second statement of first transaction then it will return the 30
so it's creating the issue of Non-Repeatable Reads
