SELECT 
	client_id,

FROM invoices
-- WHERE total_sales > 500 AND number_of_invoices > 5 if we will apply the where clause here like this then we will get the error i.e total_sales col does not exists
group by client_id
HAVING total_sales > 500 AND number_of_invoices > 5 -- we can use the where clause but as we know where clause only works on those column which are really exists in the Database
